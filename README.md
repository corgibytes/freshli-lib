# freshli
A tool for collecting historical metrics about a project's dependencies

The `freshli` tool captures historical metrics about a project's dependencies. In it's current form, the only metric that it computes is [libyear](https://libyear.com/).

For each language that the tool supports, the libyear metric is computed for each month in the past where dependency information is available.

## Supported Tools

### Languages and Dependency Frameworks

Freshli reads dependency information from special files called "dependency manifests". Each language community has a different format and some lanugage communities have multiple ones. These are the ones that we support. If you don't see one that's important to you, please create an issue for us to add support for it.

* Ruby
  * bundler - reads information from `Gemfile.lock`
* Perl
  * carton - reads information from `cpanfile`
* PHP
  * composer - reads information from `composer.json` and `composer.lock`
* Python
  * pip - reads information from `requirements.txt`

### Source Code Repositories

Freshli reads source code repository history to access previous version of each dependency manifest. These are the source code repositories that it currently works with. If you don't see your favorite, create an issue for us to add support for it.

* Git

## Getting started with `freshli` CLI

### Running `freshli`

Right now to run `freshli` from the command line, you need to have the [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core) installed.

Once you do, you can run use `dotnet run --project Freshli/Freshli.csproj -- <url>` to run the project.

Here's an example:

```
➜  freshli git:(main) ✗ dotnet run --project Freshli/Freshli.csproj -- http://github.com/corgibytes/freshli-fixture-ruby-nokotest

`freshli` should build and run on any platform that's supported by the .NET Core SDK. It is heavily tested on both macOS and Windows. If you run into problems, please open an issue. The output from above was captured from running in `zsh` on macOS Catalina (10.15.5).


### Building `freshli`

There are multiple ways to build `freshli`. The simplest is directly on the command line by running `dotnet build`.

You can also use an IDE for working on `freshli`. Most of the project's developers use JetBrains Rider, but you can also use Visual Studio 2019. If you don't want to use an IDE, then a text editor with good C# support such as Visual Studio Code or Atom also works equally well.

This is what a successful command line build looks like:

```

### Running the test suite

Simply running `dotnet test` will kick off the test runner. If you're using an IDE to build `freshli`, such as JetBrains Rider or Visual Studio 2019, then you can use the test runner that's built into the IDE.

Here's an example of a successful test run:

```
➜  freshli git:(main) ✗ dotnet test

The tests currently take longer to run than we would like. We're exploring ways to speed that up. You can run a subset of tests by including the `--filter` flag, e.g. `dotnet test --filter ComputeAsOf`.

## Saving Results

Analysis metrics can be saved to a local file by setting the `SAVE_RESULTS_TO_FILE` variable.

First, create a `.env` file  based on the sample `.env-example` file. Set `SAVE_RESULTS_TO_FILE` to `true` and run the analysis. Results will be output to a text file in a newly created `results` directory.

## Logging

[NLog](https://nlog-project.org/) is being used for logging within the application.

Configuration is in [`Freshli/NLog.config`](Freshli/NLog.config)

The logger is configured to write to the console as well as to:
  * `Freshli/bin/Debug/netcoreapp3.1/freshli.log`
  * `Freshli.Test/bin/Debug/netcoreapp3.1/freshli.log`

## Generating Graphs

### Spreadsheets

The console output is designed to make it easy to copy and paste into a spreadsheet application and take advantage of the charting libraries that are available there. Additional output formats will be added in the future.

### Jupyter Notebook

If you want to generate graphs in a Jupyter Notebook, there is some additional setup that you need to follow.

1. Install Jupyter-Lab or nteract
1. Install dontet/interactive

A [sample notebook](https://github.com/corgibytes/freshli/blob/main/Sample.ipynb) can be found in this repository.

Before working with `freshli` in a Jupyter Notebook you have to package it as a NuGet package by running `dotnet pack`.

Once that's done, you'll need to import and require `freshli` as a NuGet package by running the following.

```
#i nuget:/Users/mscottford/src/corgibytes/freshli/Freshli/bin/Debug
#r nuget:freshli,1.0.0-dev
```

You'll need to change the path above to match the absolute path where the `.nupkg` file can be found.

The following script will allow you to create simple line graphs to plot a project or multiple projects.

```csharp

using XPlot.Plotly;

using Freshli;
using Freshli.Languages.Ruby;
using Freshli.Languages.Php;
using Freshli.Languages.Python;

ManifestFinder.Register<RubyBundlerManifestFinder>();
ManifestFinder.Register<PhpComposerManifestFinder>();
ManifestFinder.Register<PipRequirementsTxtManifestFinder>();

FileHistoryFinder.Register<GitFileHistoryFinder>();

PlotlyChart CreateLineGraphFor(Dictionary<string, IList<MetricsResult>> projects) {
    var lineSeries = projects.Select(p => new Scattergl {
        name = p.Key,
        x = p.Value.Select(r => r.Date),
        y = p.Value.Select(r => r.LibYear.Total)
    });


    var chart = Chart.Plot(lineSeries.ToArray());
    chart.WithTitle("LibYear over time");
    return chart;
}
```

You can then generate a graph by running:

```csharp
var runner = new Runner();
var projects = new Dictionary<string, IList<MetrictsResult>>();
projects["example"] = runner.Run("https://github.com/corgibytes/freshli-fixture-ruby-nokotest");
display(CreateLineGraphFor(projects))
```

## Running `eclint` via docker-compose

The `eclint` container provides a convenient way to run the `eclint` command
that's used by GitHub Actions as part of every pull request. To do so simply
run the following.

```
docker-compose run eclint
```
